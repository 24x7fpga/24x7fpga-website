      <description>Hi there 👋. I&amp;rsquo;m Kiran. I work as Graduate Research Assistant at Wright State University currently pursuing my Doctoral degree.
My background includes Digital Design, RTL design, FPGA prototyping, Circuit design, and I have worked as a graduate teaching assistant while pursuing a Master’s Degree in Electrical Engineering.
As a teaching assistant I Instructed students in modeling digital systems using hardware descriptive language. Implemented and tested the designs on FPGAs. Evaluated the student&amp;rsquo;s performance based on quizzes and graded them accordingly for Digital Integrated Circuit Design Lab.</description>
