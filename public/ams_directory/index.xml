      <description>Current Current occurs when electic charge (Q) flows thorugh a wire. The current passing thorugh the wire can be given as the amount of charge Q passing through a wire in a given time t.
The general definition of current is given as the rate at which the charge passes through a wire.
\begin{equation} \label{eq.1} I = \frac{dQ}{dt} \end{equation}
where:
I is current in amperes, A Q is charge in coulomb, Q t is time in seconds, s Current is measured in amperes (A) and charge is represented as coulomb Q.</description>
