These registers play a crucial role in storing data, addresses, and intermediate results, optimizing the efficiency of program execution.\nZero Register The zero register always holds the constant value 0. Any value written to this register is discarded, making it useful for operations where a fixed zero value is required.\nStoreage Registers Registers s0–s11 and t0–t6 are primarily used for storing variables during program execution. These registers help preserve data that needs to be accessed frequently without relying on slower memory.\nFunction Calls Certain registers in RISC-V are designated for handling function calls. The ra (return address) register stores the address to which the program should return after a function completes. Additionally, registers a0–a7 are used for passing function arguments and storing return values.\nStack Pointer The stack pointer sp is a register that holds the address of the stack (memory). It typically points to the top of the stack and updates as data is pushed or popped, decreasing when new data is stored and increasing when data is removed. This register primarily utilized in function calls, local variable storage, and managing program execution flow.\nGlobal Pointer The global pointer gp is a register used to access globally stored variables before a program starts executing. It provides a reference to static and global variables, allowing efficient memory access without repeated address calculations during runtime\nThread Pointer This a register that is dedicated to store the thread’s local memory. A thread is smallest unit of instructions within a process that take turns being executed on the processor. A program running on the computer is called a process. Computer can multiple processes at the same time, each process consists of one or more threads running simultanelously.\n",

<p>RISC-V features a total of 32 registers, numbered from 0 to 31, each serving a specific purpose. These registers play a crucial role in storing data, addresses, and intermediate results, optimizing the efficiency of program execution.</p>
<h4 id="zero-register">Zero Register<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#zero-register">#</a></h4>
<p>The <code>zero</code> register always holds the constant value 0. Any value written to this register is discarded, making it useful for operations where a fixed zero value is required.</p>
<h4 id="storeage-registers">Storeage Registers<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#storeage-registers">#</a></h4>
<p>Registers <code>s0–s11</code> and <code>t0–t6</code> are primarily used for storing variables during program execution. These registers help preserve data that needs to be accessed frequently without relying on slower memory.</p>
<h4 id="function-calls">Function Calls<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#function-calls">#</a></h4>
<p>Certain registers in RISC-V are designated for handling function calls. The <code>ra</code> (return address) register stores the address to which the program should return after a function completes. Additionally, registers <code>a0–a7</code> are used for passing function arguments and storing return values.</p>

<p>The stack pointer <code>sp</code> is a register that holds the address of the stack (memory). It typically points to the top of the stack and updates as data is pushed or popped, decreasing when new data is stored and increasing when data is removed. This register primarily utilized in function calls, local variable storage, and managing program execution flow.</p>

<h4 id="thread-pointer">Thread Pointer<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#thread-pointer">#</a></h4>
<p>This a register that is dedicated to store the thread&rsquo;s local memory. A <code>thread</code> is smallest unit of instructions within a process that take turns being executed on the processor. A program running on the computer is called a <code>process</code>. Computer can multiple processes at the same time, each process consists of one or more threads running simultanelously.</p>
