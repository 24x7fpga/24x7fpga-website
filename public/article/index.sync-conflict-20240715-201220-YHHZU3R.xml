      <description>Throughput and latency are fundamental concepts in moderm digital system. Throughput refers to the time the system takes to process the data per clock cycle where latency refers to the time it takes for the data to travese from one location to another to complete an operation. High throughput and low latency are essentail for today&amp;rsquo;s fast-paced digital world. For example, higher throughput ensure smooth and uninterrupted audio and video streaming and low latency provides seamless and responsive gaming experience reducing lag.</description>
