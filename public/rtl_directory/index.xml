Latchs and Flip-Flops are fundamental digital components used to store information. Both play a critical role in sequential circuits, but they differ in their operation and applications.
Latch A latch is level-sensitive memory element that stores a single bit of data. It operates based on the state of an enable signal:
Transparent Mode: When the enable signal is active, the latch allows data to flow through, making it &amp;ldquo;transparent.</description>

In Verilog, == and === are both used for comparison, but they behave differently in how they handle X (unknown).
== Equality The == operator checks if two values are logically equal. It used for comparisons on only 1&amp;rsquo;s and 0&amp;rsquo;s. If any operand contains an X, the comparison result will be a unknown value.
Example: 4&amp;#39;b101X == 4&amp;#39;b1011; // Result: x (unknown) 4&amp;#39;b1X00 == 4&amp;#39;b1100; // Result: x (unknown) === Equality The === operator is a strict equality check.</description>

It facilitates communication by transmitting data sequentially over a single line, making it ideal for scenarios where minimal wiring is preferred.
Transmitter: Converts parallel data into a serial stream for transmission over a single communication line. Receiver: Converts the incoming serial data back into parallel form for further processing.</description>

Clock Gating Clock gating is a widely used technique to reduce dynamic power consumption in digital circuits, particularly in complex systems like processors and FPGAs. Before diving into the benefits of clock gating, let’s take a look at the following SystemVerilog code snippet:
always_ff@(posedge clk) if(en) Dout &amp;lt;= Din; The gate-level diagram of this code is illustrated in Figure 1. In this design, a multiplexer (MUX) controls the data flow, ensuring that when the &amp;lsquo;En&amp;rsquo; signal is high, &amp;lsquo;Din&amp;rsquo; is passed to &amp;lsquo;Dout&amp;rsquo; on the next clock edge.</description>

Asynchronous FIFO An Asynchronous FIFO is a type of buffer where the write and read operations are controlled by different or unsynchronized clock signals. This makes it ideal for digital systems where data is transferred between components running at different speeds, such as when data is transmitted from a peripheral device to a CPU operating at a different clock frequency than that of the peripheral.</description>

Synchronous FIFO A FIFO (First-In-First-Out) is a storage buffer that is widely used in digital systems where the data that is stored in the memory is retrieved first, hence the name FIFO.
A synchronous FIFO is a type of FIFO where the write and read operations are synchronized with the same clock signal.

The data retrieval is based on the order of the data written to the FIFO buffer.</description>

Finite State Machine A Finite State Machine (FSM) is a mathematical model used to represent a system with a finite number of states and a set of transitions between those states, driven by inputs. Each state can be considered as a decision node, where the decision is based on the input and or the input and the current decision tree node.

Always@(*) and Always_Comb In digital design, both always @(*) in Verilog and always_comb in SystemVerilog are commonly used to model combinational logic. While they serve a similar purpose, there are important differences that make always_comb the preferred choice in modern design flows. In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore these differences and explain why always_comb offers enhanced safety and robustness over always @(*) in SystemVerilog-based designs.
Always@(*) In Verilog, the always @(*) construct was introduced to simplify the sensitivity list in combinational logic.</description>

It is typically implemented where the output continuously reflects the changes in the input without any delay. The assign statement is used with signals declared as wire, tri, or other net types, but not with reg types.

Full Case and Parallel Case The case statement is a fundamental construct used for conditional branching across various programming languages. In SystemVerilog, it is implemented as a simple if-else-if statement. SystemVerilog introduces two specialized variations of the case statement, casex and casez, that allow for handling &amp;ldquo;don&amp;rsquo;t care&amp;rdquo; conditions in the case items, discussed in Casex and Casez.
The case statement can be caterogired as full and parallel based on the how the case items are being matched to case expression.</description>

Shift Register: An Overview A shift register is a set of sequential registers placed in series to transfer and store data. The figure below shows a 4-bit serial shift register.
The waveform below shows the data being shifted from flip-flop 1 to 4 on the rising edge of the clock.
Applications Shift registers are typically used to collect and transfer data for various applications. They are also used for data conversion, the types of data converters are listed below:</description>

Register: An Overview A register in digital design is a fast storage sequential circuit that can hold data temporarily. A widely used register is D Flip-FLop. A D Flip-Flop is an edge-triggered circuit that combines a pair of latches to store one bit.
Advantages of Registers Registers provide fast access to data compared to main memory. Ideal for temporary storage during data processing. Desgin: D Flip-Flop A D Flip-Flop is an edge-trigger register, either positive edge-triggered, negative edge-triggered, or dual edge-triggered.</description>

Comparator: An Overview A comparator is a fundamental building block in digital design that compares two binary numbers. Comparators can be categorized based on their use and functionality.
Equality Comparator: it compares the two binary numbers to up a true bit or high when all the binary bits are identical and false or low when the bits are not identical. Magnitude Comparator: has three functionality, to determine the relationship between the two binary numbers that are being compared.</description>

Encoder: An Overview An encoder is a digital combinational circuit that converts 2^n inputs to n outputs. It converts a set of binary inputs to binary-coded output, where only one input line is active at a given time.
Design: 4-to-2 Encoder A 4-to-2 encoder, where n = 2 i.e., it consists of 2^n = 2^2 = 4 input lines named as in[3], in[2], in[1], in[0] and two output lines named as out[1] and out[0].</description>

De-Multiplexer (DEMUX): An Overview A DEMUX or data distributor is a one-to-many combinational circuit that receives inputs from a single input line and transmits the same information over one of &amp;rsquo;n&amp;rsquo; possible output lines. DEMUX transmits the same data that is received on the input to different destinations. A de-multiplexer is a 1-to-N device, where N/n is the number of outputs and with &amp;rsquo;m&amp;rsquo; select line, therefore, 2^m = n.</description>

Multiplexer (MUX): An Overview A multiplexer is a digital circuit that selects one input out of many inputs, hence, it is also called a data selector. It consists of 2^n inputs with n selector lines, which are used to select which input to send to the output.
Need For Multiplexers The need for MUXs arises wherever there is a need to transmit multiple data over a shared communication channel.</description>
