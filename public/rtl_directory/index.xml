Full Case and Parallel Case The case statement is a fundamental construct used for conditional branching across various programming languages. In SystemVerilog, it is implemented as a simple if-else-if statement. SystemVerilog introduces two specialized variations of the case statement, casex and casez, that allow for handling &amp;ldquo;don&amp;rsquo;t care&amp;rdquo; conditions in the case items, discussed in Casex and Casez.
The case statement can be caterogired as full and parallel based on the how the case items are being matched to case expression.</description>

      <description>Introduction Speed in digital design can have three primary meanings/definitions based on the context of the problem. There are as follows:
Throughput: refers to the amount of time a system takes to process the data per clock cycle, measured in bits per second. Latency: refers to the time between the input and the processed output, measured as clock cycles. Timing: refers to the logic delays between the sequential elements, the standard metric is clock period or frequency.</description>

Mod-N Counter: An Overview A modulo-N counter (Mod-N) is counter that counts from 0 to N-1 and then wraps back to 0. This type of counter is useful in [Frequency Divider], timers and state machines. The number of flop-flop required to calculate a mod-N counter is ceil(log2(N)). Forexample: for a mod 10 counter the number of flip-flop required is 4 (ceil(log2(10))).
Verilog Code: Mod-N Counter module mod_cntr #(parameter N = 4)(/*AUTOARG*/ // Outputs mod_cntr, // Inputs clk, rst ); // Outputs output [N-1:0] mod_cntr; // Inputs input	clk; input	rst; logic [$clog2(N)-1:0] cntr_reg, cntr_nxt; /*AUTOREG*/ /*AUTOWIRE*/ always_ff@(posedge clk) if(rst) cntr_reg &amp;lt;= 0; else cntr_reg &amp;lt;= cntr_nxt; always_comb cntr_nxt = (cntr_reg == N-1) ?</description>
