## Current {#current}

Current occurs when electic charge (Q) flows through a wire. The current passing through the wire can be given as the amount of charge **Q** passing through a wire in a given time **t**.

The general definition of current is given as the rate at which the charge passes through a wire.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq.1}
I = \frac{dQ}{dt}
\end{equation}

where:

-   I is current in amperes, A
-   Q is charge in coulomb, Q
-   t is time in seconds, s

Current is measured in _amperes (A)_ and charge is represented as _coulomb Q_.


### Points to Remember {#points-to-remember}

1.  Each current has a value and a direction
2.  In an open circuit the current is zero.
3.  The amount of charge passing through a wire in a certain amount of time T is given as:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq.2}
Q = \int\_{0}^{T} I \quad dt
\end{equation}

where:

-   Q is charge in coulomb, Q
-   T is time in seconds, s
-   I is current in amperes, A

This describes the that the amount of charge in time T is defined as the area under the curve.


## Voltage {#voltage}

Voltage is the potential difference between two points **A** and **B**, it the measure of amount of energy required to move a positive unit charge from point **A** to point **B** in an electrial circuit.


### Points to Remember {#points-to-remember}

1.  A voltage has a value and sign.
2.  A voltage diffenerce exists only between two points/nodes.
3.  Votage is zero in a short circuit.


## Resistor {#resistor}

A resistor is passive electonic element that obstructs the flow of current. A resistor dissipates electical energy in the form of heat, unlike active elements that amplify the energy, e.g., transistors and op-amps.


## Ohm's Law {#ohm-s-law}

Ohmâ€™s Law is one of the most fundamental principles in electrical engineering, describing the relationship between voltage (V), current (I), and resistance (R). It states that the voltage across a resistor is directly proportional to the current flowing through it, given by the equation:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq.3}
V = I \times R
\end{equation}

where:

-   V is voltage in volts, V
-   I is cuurent in amperes, A
-   R is resistance in ohm, &Omega;
