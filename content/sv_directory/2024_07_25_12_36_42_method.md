## Class Methods {#class-methods}

A class method is a task or a function defined inside the scope of the class. A method in a class uses **automatic** storage by default.


### Example: Methods in a Class {#example-methods-in-a-class}

```verilog
class Ex_class;
   // class properties or variables
  int a, b, s;

   // task method
  task sum (int a,b);
    s = a + b;
    $display("a = %0d , b = %0d, sum s = %0d", a, b ,s);
  endtask

endclass

```


### Defining Methods Outside of Class {#defining-methods-outside-of-class}

To keep the code short, and easy to read and understand, it is advisable to keep the class to one "page" or to the screen of the editor. In case, if a method takes more than a page, you can break the method into the prototype(method name and arguments) inside the class, and the body(the procedural code) outside the class. To create an out-of-block declaration,

1.  Copy the first line of the method, with the name and arguments, and add the **extern** keyword at the beginning.
2.  Place the entire method outside of the class, and add the class name and two colons (: : the scope operator) before the method name.


#### Example: Method outside of the class {#example-method-outside-of-the-class}

```verilog
class Ex_class;
   // class properties or variables
   int a, b, s;
   extern task sum (int a,b);
endclass

// task method outside the class
task Ex_class::sum (int a,b);
        s = a + b;
        $display("a = %0d , b = %0d, sum s = %0d", a, b ,s);
endtask



module test;

  Ex_class cl_obj;      // declare a class handle of type cl_obj

   initial begin
     cl_obj = new( );   // construct an object
     cl_obj.sum(30,10); // access a method
     repeat(10)
        cl_obj.sum($urandom_range(1,50),$urandom_range(1,50));
   end

endmodule
```

### Points to Remember {#points-to-remember}

1.  The prototype (header of the routine) should match with the out-of-body declaration with the prefix keyword extern, except for the class name and scope operator(: :).
2.  The class name along with the scope operator must be included in the out-of-body declaration.
