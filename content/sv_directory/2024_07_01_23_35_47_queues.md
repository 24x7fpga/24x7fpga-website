## Queues {#queues}

Queue is a new data type introduced in SystemVerilog that combines the best of a linked list and an array.

-   Like a linked list, elements can be added and removed anywhere in the queue, without performance degradation when using a dynamic array that has to allocate a new array and copy the entire contents.
-   Like an array, any element in the queue can be directly accessed with the help of the index, without the linked list's overhead of stepping through the preceding element.

A queue is declared with the word subscript containing a dollar sign "[$]". The elements in the queue are numbered from 0 to $. Initializing a queue is different for arrays as the initial apostrophe is not required and the elements must be declared inside the curly brackets. SystemVerilog allocates extra space for a queue so that you don't run out of space when filling up a queue. This way a queue can grow and shrink without any performance penalty of a dynamic array.

The queue elements are stored in a contiguous location, so it is efficient to push and pop elements from the front and back. Adding and deleting elements in the middle of a queue requires shifting the existing data to make room and time to do this grows linearly with the size of the queue.

Queue example in SystemVerilog is shown below:

```verilog
module queues ();

  int q[$] = {1,2,3,4,5};
  int k;

  initial begin


    $display("------------------  Queue  ------------------");
    foreach(q[i])$display("\t q[%0d]=%0d",i, q[i]);

    k = q.pop_front();
    $display("-----------------  Pop Front -----------------");
    $display("\t k=%0d", k);

    k = q.pop_back();
    $display("-----------------  Pop Back  -----------------");
    $display("\t k=%0d", k);


    q.push_front(9);
    $display("--------------  Insert @ Front  --------------");
    foreach(q[i])$display("\t q[%0d]=%0d",i, q[i]);


    q.push_back(0);
    $display("--------------  Insert @ Back  -_-------------");
    foreach(q[i])$display("\t q[%0d]=%0d",i, q[i]);

    q.delete(1);
    $display("--------------  Delete Element  --------------");
    foreach(q[i])$display("\t q[%0d]=%0d",i, q[i]);

  end
endmodule
```
