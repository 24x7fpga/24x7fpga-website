## Dynamic Cast {#dynamic-cast}

Casting refers to conversion of a variable to one data type to another data type. SystemVerilog provides two types of casting,

1.  [Static Cast]({{< relref "2024_07_02_18_32_19_static_cast.md" >}})ing
2.  [Dynamic Cast]({{< relref "2024_07_02_18_41_56_dynamic_cast.md" >}})ing


### Dynamic Casting {#dynamic-casting}

Dynamic casting in SystemVerilog allows you to safely convert a handle of one class type to another class type at runtime, ensuring the cast is valid and the object is of the target type. The dynamic cast, $cast, allows you to check for out-of-bounds values. Use dynamic cast when converting from a type with a large number of values than the destination, such as int to an enumerated variables.


#### Syntax {#syntax}

```verilog
$cast (target_handle, source_handel);
```

-   target_handle: is the handle to which to convert.
-   source_handle: the handle from which to convert from.
