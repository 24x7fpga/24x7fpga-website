## Fork Join Any {#fork-join-any}

Fork join any construct is similar to [Fork Join]({{< relref "2024_07_20_21_47_05_fork_join.md" >}}) but the simulation process does not wait till all the threads are completed. It proceeds to the next execution statement as soon as any one of the threads completes the process.

Fork join any is depicted in the figure below.
