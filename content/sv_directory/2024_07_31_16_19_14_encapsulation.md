## Encapsulation {#encapsulation}

Encapsulation is a technique used to restrict access to the data and methods within a class, ensuring that internal class details are not accessible from outside the class.


### Access Specifiers {#access-specifiers}

These define the visibility of class members and they are as follows:


#### Local {#local}

Members declared as local are accessible only within the class itself.

<!--list-separator-->

-  Syntax

    ```verilog
    class ex;
       local int a;

       function new();
          // execute code
       endfunction

    endclass
    ```


#### Protected {#protected}

Members declared as protected are accessible within the class and its derived classes.

<!--list-separator-->

-  Syntax

    ```verilog
    class ex;
       protected int a;

       function new();
          // execute code
       endfunction

    endclass
    ```


#### Public {#public}

Members declared as public are accessible from anywhere.

<!--list-separator-->

-  Syntax

    ```verilog
    class ex;
       public int a;

       function new();
          // execute code
       endfunction

    endclass
    ```


##  {#d41d8c}

Note: By default, all properties and methods of a class in SystemVerilog are **public** and can be accessed from anywhere using the object handle.
