## Handle {#handle}

A handle is a pointer to an object created from a [Class]({{< relref "2024_07_24_16_47_44_class.md" >}}). Handles are crucial in dynamically creating and managing [Object]({{< relref "2024_07_24_17_42_06_object.md" >}})s during simulation.


### Syntax: Handle {#syntax-handle}

```verilog
Ex_class cl_obj;    // declare a handle
cl_obj = new();     // allocate a Ex_class object
```


##  {#d41d8c}

When the handle 'cl_obj' is declared, it is initialized to a **null** value. Call the **new()** function to construct the **Ex_class** object. The new function allocates space for Ex_class, initializes the variables to their default values (0 for 2-state and x for 4-state variable), and returns the address where the object is stored. This is similar to calling a malloc function in C language. The new function is called the **constructor**, as it builds the object.

Note: You **DECLARE** a handle and **CONSTRUCT** an object.


### Difference Between new( ) and new[ ] {#difference-between-new-----and-new}

1.  new( ): is function called to construct an object.
2.  new[ ]: is an operator used for arrays.


### Allocating Multiple Objects {#allocating-multiple-objects}

```verilog
Ex_class cl_obj1, cl_obj2;  // declare two handles
cl_obj1 = new();            // allocate the first object
cl_obj2 = new();            // allocate the second object
```
