## Array Methods {#array-methods}

Array methods are generic manipulation methods that apply to the entire array rather than iterating to every element in the array.


### Basic Array Operations {#basic-array-operations}

1.  Copy: an array can be copied completely to another array without using a loop statement.
2.  Compare: two arrays can be compared for equality and inequality.

Keep in mind that two arrays that are being compared or copied must be of the same base type and size.


### Array Reduction Methods {#array-reduction-methods}

A basic array reduction method takes an array and reduces it to a single value. Some of the array reduction methods are as follows:

| Method             | Description                                              |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| sum()              | Calculates the sum of the array                          |
| product()          | returns the product of the array                         |
| and(), or(), xor() | performs bitwise logical operation on the array elements |


### Array Locator Methods {#array-locator-methods}

Array locator methods provide easy and fast access to elements in an array. Some of the methods include a "with" clause, which tells SystemVerilog how to perform the search.

| Method             | Descprition                                                                    |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| min()              | returns the minimum element in the array                                       |
| max()              | returns the maximum element in the array                                       |
| unique()           | returns a queue of unique values from the array, duplicates are not included   |
| find()             | returns all the elements satisfying the expression, eg. find with (item &gt;4) |
| find_index()       | returns all the index of the array that satisfies the expression               |
| find_fisrt_index() | returns the index of the first value that satisfies the expression             |
| find_last()        | returns the last elements that satisfy the expression                          |
| find_last_index()  | returns the index of the last element that satisfies the expression            |

In a "with" clause, the name "item" is called the iterator argument that represents a single element of the array. You can combine an array reduction method using the with clause for some unique operations.


### Array Sorting and Ordering {#array-sorting-and-ordering}

SystemVerilog provides a means to change the order of elements in an array with the following commands:

| Method    | Description                                                |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| reverse() | returns an array with elements arranged from last to first |
| sort()    | returns an array in ascending order                        |
| rsort()   | returns an array in descending order                       |
| shuffle() | randomizes the order of array                              |

NOTE: The reverse and shuffle methods do not have a "with" clause. They work on the entire array.
