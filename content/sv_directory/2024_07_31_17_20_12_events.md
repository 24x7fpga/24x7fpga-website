Interprocess communication is a way to communicate between different processes and testbench components. There are three mechanisms:

1.  Events
2.  Mailbox
3.  Semaphores


## Events {#events}

Events are static objects in SystemVerilog, used to synchronize different testbench components. The events are triggered using **-&gt;** or **-&gt;&gt;** and the process can wait for the event to be triggered using  ****@**** operator or **wait()** construct.

| Event      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| - &gt;     | Blocking events, also know as instanteous event, block the process untill the event is triggered.                                                                                                              |
| - &gt;&gt; | Non-blocking events, using this operator does not block the process. Can be used when two events are triggere at the same time.                                                                                |
| @          | Blocks the calling process untill the given event is triggered. This is an edge-sensitive operator, hence, waiting event should be triggered before triggering an event to aviod blocking the waiting process. |
| wait()     | Unlike ****@**** operator, the **wait()** construct does not block the process. Triggering an event and waiting for an event can occur at the same time.                                                       |

This is a two stage mechanism where:

1.  First Stage: trigger an event.
2.  Second Stage: wait for an event to be triggered.


### Three Types of Event Trigger {#three-types-of-event-trigger}

Events are distinguished based on which stage occurs first.

1.  Type A: Second stage and then first stage.
2.  Type B: First stage followed by second stage.
3.  Type C: First and second stage occurs at the same time.

Combination of event triggers(-&gt; and -&gt;&gt;) and wait responses(@ and wait()) can be used to synchronize processes based on the requirement.


#### Type A {#type-a}

The wait event is triggered first followed by the event.

```verilog
// class
class event_typeA;

  event ev;

  task ev_trg();
     #10;
     $display("t= %0t => Trigger event", $time);
     ->ev;
     $display("t= %0t => Event is triggered", $time);
  endtask

  task wait_trg();
     #5;
     $display("t= %0t => Wait for the event", $time);
     @ev;
     //wait(ev.triggered);    // uncomment to comment @ev to see the difference
     $display("t= %0t => Wait event is triggered", $time);
   endtask

endclass


module test;

   event_typeA ev_a;          // class handle

  task run(event_typeA arg);
    arg.ev_trg();
    arg.wait_trg();
  endtask

   initial begin
     ev_a = new( );           // construct the class object

     $display("---------------------- Event: Type A ----------------------");
     run(ev_a);

   end

endmodule
```

#### Type B {#type-b}

The event is triggered first followed by the wait event.

```verilog
// class
class event_typeB;

  event ev;

  task ev_trg();
    #10;
    $display("t = %0t => Trigger event", $time);
    ->ev;
    $display("t = %0t => Event is triggered", $time);
  endtask

  task wait_trg();
    #15;
    $display("t = %0t => Wait for the event", $time);
    @(ev);
    //wait(ev.triggered);
    $display("t= %0t => Wait event is triggered", $time);
   endtask

endclass


module test;

   event_typeB ev_b;          // class handle

  task run(event_typeB arg);
    fork
        arg.ev_trg();
        arg.wait_trg();
    join
  endtask

   initial begin
     ev_b = new( );           // construct the class object

     $display("---------------------- Event: Type B ----------------------");
     run(ev_b);

   end

endmodule
```

#### Type C {#type-c}

Event trigger and wait event both are triggered at the same time.

```verilog
// class
class event_typeC;

  event ev;

  task ev_trg();
    $display("t = %0t => Trigger event", $time);
    ->ev;
    $display("t = %0t => Event is triggered", $time);
  endtask

  task wait_trg();
    $display("t = %0t => Wait for the event", $time);
    @(ev);
    //wait(ev.triggered);
    $display("t= %0t => Wait event is triggered", $time);
   endtask

endclass


module test;

   event_typeC ev_c;          // class handle

  task run(event_typeC arg);
    fork
        arg.ev_trg();
        arg.wait_trg();
    join
  endtask

   initial begin
     ev_c = new( );           // construct the class object

     $display("---------------------- Event: Type C ----------------------");
     run(ev_c);

   end

endmodule
```

### Difference between ******@****** Operator and **wait()** Construct {#difference-between-operator-and-wait-construct}

The wait event does not block the process. When both the event and wait event is triggered at the same it always best to use a **wait()** construct. If the event triggering and waiting for event trigger with ****@**** operator happens at the same time, ****@**** operator may miss detecting the event trigger.

```verilog
// class
class event_typeC;

  event ev;

  task ev_trg();
    $display("t = %0t => Trigger event", $time);
    ->ev;
    $display("t = %0t => Event is triggered", $time);
  endtask

  task wait_trg();
    $display("t = %0t => Wait for the event", $time);
    //@(ev);
    wait(ev.triggered);
    $display("t= %0t => Wait event is triggered", $time);
   endtask

endclass


module test;

   event_typeC ev_c;          // class handle

  task run(event_typeC arg);
    fork
        arg.ev_trg();
        arg.wait_trg();
    join
  endtask

   initial begin
     ev_c = new( );           // construct the class object

     $display("---------------------- Event: Type C ----------------------");
     run(ev_c);

   end

endmodule
```

### Difference between **-&gt;** and **-&gt;&gt;** Event Triggers {#difference-between-and-event-triggers}

Similar to the ****@**** operator and the **wait()** construct, the **-&gt;** operator blocks the process until it is triggered, while the **-&gt;&gt;** operator does not block the process. When using the -&gt;&gt; operator, irrespective of the ****@**** operator or the **wait()** construct, the process continues to execute. The following code illustrates these differences more clearly.

```verilog
// class
class event_typeC;

  event ev;

  task ev_trg();
    $display("t = %0t => Trigger event", $time);
    ->>ev;
    $display("t = %0t => Event is triggered", $time);
  endtask

  task wait_trg();
    $display("t = %0t => Wait for the event", $time);
    @(ev);                     // comment and uncomment
    //wait(ev.triggered);      // comment and uncomment
    $display("t= %0t => Wait event is triggered", $time);
   endtask

endclass


module test;

   event_typeC ev_c;          // class handle

  task run(event_typeC arg);
    fork
        arg.ev_trg();
        arg.wait_trg();
    join
  endtask

   initial begin
     ev_c = new( );           // construct the class object

     $display("---------------------- Event: Type C ----------------------");
     run(ev_c);

   end

endmodule
```
