## Object {#object}

An object is an instance od a class. It is similar to the instantiation of a module in Verilog, but there are some differences which as listed in the table below:

| Verilog Module Instance                                                     | SystemVerilog Class Instance                                                        |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| A module is instantiated during compile time                                | A class is instantiated during simulation when needed by the testbench              |
| Verilog instances are static, as hardware does not change during simulation | Class objects are created when required and freed from memory when no longer needed |

The **'new'** keyword is used to instantiate the object.

```verilog
class Ex_class;
   // class properties or variables
  int a, b, s;

   // task method
  task sum (int a,b);
    s = a + b;
    $display("a = %0d , b = %0d, sum s = %0d", a, b ,s);
  endtask

endclass


module test;

  Ex_class cl_obj;      // declare a class handle of type cl_obj

   initial begin
     cl_obj = new( );   // create an object
     cl_obj.sum(30,10); // access a method
     repeat(10)
        cl_obj.sum($urandom_range(1,50),$urandom_range(1,50));
   end

endmodule
```

### Points to Remember {#points-to-remember}

1.  Objects are created dynamically using **'new'** keyword.
2.  Properties (variables) of an object can be accessed using a handle.
3.  Objects are allocated on the heap, and their lifetime is managed by the simulation runtime.
4.  Objects from one class can communicate with objects in another class, efficient in managing different verification environments.
