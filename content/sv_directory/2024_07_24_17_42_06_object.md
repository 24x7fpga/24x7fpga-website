## Object {#object}

An object is an instance od a class. It is similar to instantiation of a module in Verilog, but there are some differences which as listed in the table below:

| Verilog Module Instance                                                     | SystemVerilog Class Instance                                                        |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| A module is instantiated during compile time                                | A class is instantiated during simulation, when needed by the testbench             |
| Verilog instances are static, as hardware does not change during simulation | Class objects are created when required and freed from memory when no longer needed |
