The B-type (_branch_) instruction is similar to the S-type (_store_) instruction. It differs slightly with the use of immediate values. Figure 1 illustrate the fields of the _branch_ type instruction.

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/b_type.svg" caption="<span class=\"figure-number\">Figure 1: </span>Instruction Format" >}}

-   Opcode: The opcode or operation code is a 7-bit field that defines the type of operation to be performed.
-   Function Field: This 3-bit `funct3` field, known as the **control bits**, determines the specific operation to be executed such as store byte (`sb`), store half (`sh`) and store word (`sw`).
-   Registers: The register `rs1` is the base address of source register and `rs2` is the value to be stored to memory.
-   Immeditate Field: The two immediate fields together make up 13-bit signed offset number for the base address in `rs1`.

Immeditate instruction is describe much more clearly w.r.t to the _branch_ instruction `instr` below:

-   imm[12]   = instr[31]
-   imm[11]   = instr[7]
-   imm[10:5] = instr[30:25]
-   imm[4:1]  = instr[11:8]
-   imm[0]    = 0

This bit arrangement is opted to ensure that immediate bits occupy the same instruction bits across different instruction formats as much as possible and that the sign bit is always in `instr[31]`.

**Note**: The **imm[0]** is always **zero** ,hence, not include in the immediate encoded fields hence out 13-bit signed only 12 bits are encoded in the `imm` instruction..

Below is table that describes the list of B-type instructions.
