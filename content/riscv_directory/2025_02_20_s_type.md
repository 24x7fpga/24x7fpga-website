The S-type (_store_) instruction operates on two registers and one immediate operand. There are two immediate fields that together form a 12-bit signed immediate value. Figure 1 illustrates the instruction format for an S-type instruction, showing how the register, opcode, and immediate fields are segregated.

-   Opcode: The opcode or operation code is a 7-bit field that defines the type of operation to be performed.
-   Function Field: This 3-bit `funct3` field, known as the **control bits**, determines the specific operation to be executed such as store byte (`sb`), store half (`sh`) and store word (`sw`).
-   Registers: The register `rs1` is the base address of source register and `rs2` is the value to be stored to memory.
-   Immeditate Field: The two immediate fields together make up 12-bit signed offset number for the base address in `rs1`.

Below is table that describes the list of S-type instructions.
