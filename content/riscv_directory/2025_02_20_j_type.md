The J-type (_jump_) instruction is similar to the U-type instruction but differs only in the way the immediate field is arranged. Figure 1 describes how the J-type instruction format is divided into its respective fields.

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/j_type.svg" caption="<span class=\"figure-number\">Figure 1: </span>Instruction Format" >}}

-   Opcode: The opcode or operation code is a `7-bit` field that defines the type of operation to be performed.
-   Destination Register: Stores the result of the operation in the destination register `rd`.
-   Immediate Field: A `20-bit` immediate value is the difference of the label address and `jal` address such that the addition of the `jal` and `diff` is equal to label address.

**Note**: The ordinary `j` jump instruction is encoded as `jal` where `rd` is set to _zero_.

Below is table that describes the list of U-type instructions.
