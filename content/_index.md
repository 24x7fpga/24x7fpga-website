<!-- I work as Graduate Research Assistant at Wright State University currently pursuing my Doctoral degree. You can find more about my research [here](research/2024_07_08_10_15_40_research).

During my internship at Ambarella, Inc., I acquired hands-on experience in developing and automating timing assertions for MIPI-DPHY IP, optimizing the verification of D-PHY data and clock lanes, and significantly reducing overall verification time. I also designed a three-phase encoding algorithm for MIPI-CPHY transmitter and receiver modules. My responsibilities included performing formal verification by creating testbenches and assertions to ensure precise adherence to timing and functional specifications.

My background includes Digital Design, RTL design, FPGA prototyping, Circuit design, and I have worked as a graduate teaching assistant while pursuing a Master’s Degree in Electrical Engineering.

As a teaching assistant I Instructed students in modeling digital systems using hardware descriptive language. Implemented and tested the designs on FPGAs. Evaluated the student's performance based on quizzes and graded them accordingly for Digital Integrated Circuit Design Lab.

My research focus is on wideband digital receivers for radar applications.

With a strong background in Digital Design, RTL Design, and FPGA Prototyping, I have also honed my skills as a Graduate Teaching Assistant while pursuing my Master’s Degree in Electrical Engineering. In this role, I guided students in modeling digital systems using hardware descriptive languages, implemented and tested their designs on FPGAs, and evaluated their performance through quizzes and grading in the Digital Integrated Circuit Design Lab.

Through these experiences, I have developed a deep passion for crafting efficient digital systems and mentoring others in the field of digital design and verification.

FPGAs are often compared to _LEGO_ blocks where you can build a complex structure using small basic blocks. In my [GitHub](https://github.com/24x7fpga) repositories I present to you some of these basic building blocks (basic designs in verilog/system verilog) that can be used as a foundation for building large and complex systems.
