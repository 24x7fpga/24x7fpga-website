UVM stands for Universal Verification Method developed by [UVM Working Group](https://www.accellera.org/activities/working-groups/uvm) that provides a standardized methodology for verifying digital integrated circuits. UVM is built on top of SystemVerilog and provides a useful [framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framework) for creating reusable and scalable testbenchs. The framework provides a set of building blocks or pre-built design kits that help to create a complex system in a more organized and efficient way instead of building everything from scratch. The verification method uses a [factory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_(object-oriented_programming)) [method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern) to create an object instead of using a direct constructor call to create an object. This method allows the code to instantiate a specific class at runtime. This directory contains examples specifically focused on UVM verification design.
