## Register: An Overview {#register-an-overview}

A register in digital design is fast storage sequenctial circuit that can hold data temporarily. A widely used register is D Flip-FLop. A D Flip-Flop is an edge-triggered circuit that combines a pair of latches to store on bit.


### Advantages of Registers {#advantages-of-registers}

1.  Registers provide fast access to data compared to main memory.
2.  Ideal for temporary storage during data processing.


### Desgin: D Flip-Flop {#desgin-d-flip-flop}

A D Flip-Flop is a edge-trigger register, either postive edge-triggered, negative edge-triggered or dual edge-triggered. For the purpose of discussion let's consider positive edge-triggered flop-flop.

The truth table of a positive edge-triggered D Flip-Flop is shown below:

| Clk     | D | Q | Description |
|---------|---|---|-------------|
| 0       | X | Q | No Change   |
| 0-&gt;1 | 0 | 0 | Q to 0      |
| 0-&gt;1 | 1 | 1 | Q to 1      |
| 1       | X | Q | No Change   |


#### Verilog Code: D Flip-Flop {#verilog-code-d-flip-flop}

```verilog
always_ff@(posedge clk)
  if(rst)
    q <= 1'b0;
  else
    q <= d;
```
