## Half Adder {#half-adder}

Half adder is a combinational arithmetic circuit. Its functionality is to add two 1-bit binary digits to produce a sum bit and carry as the output.

Half adder truth table:

| A | B | Sum (S) | Carry (Co) |
|---|---|---------|------------|
| 0 | 0 | 0       | 0          |
| 0 | 1 | 1       | 0          |
| 1 | 0 | 1       | 0          |
| 1 | 1 | 0       | 1          |

Boolean equation for sum and carry can be written as :

-   Sum = A xor B
-   Carry = A and B

Half adder can be modelled in verilog using data flow representation:

```verilog { copy-button="t" }
assign s  = a ^ b;
assign co = a & b;
```
